It gives the whole team a chance to read and validate applications fairly quickly! This system even led us to remove the customs officer role and manage roles to filter spam and bots.\n\nIf you write at even a decent speed, this shouldn‚Äôt take more than 5 minutes, and validation can be just as fast! If you want to do this by voice, please still fill out the form as best as you can and mention inside that you‚Äôd like to talk to a team member without having to write.\n\n# Make sure to fill out the form properly, 2 sentences aren‚Äôt enough, please put some effort in!\n\nClick the button to get started.`
