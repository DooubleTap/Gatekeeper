# Whitelister
Discord.js 14 bot made to handle whitelisting to a server with a form.

I was using a website like Gather.sh to handle whitelisting of players on my discord server. It was really useful, because we are a strict roleplay server on Fivem and we like to validate players coming in the community with a small resum√© of their experience on other servers. 

I figured that using a website, for something that could be done directly in discord would be so much better and would reduce the usage of 3rd party software that is often not free. 

This bot, can be started from your own pc, or from a windows/linux VPS or Dedi. (Usually people with FiveM servers will have a server hosted somewhere, i suggest a OVH Game-1 or 2 Dedi as it comes with a Mitigation that is pretty amazing (anti-ddos))

Here is a guide to install this bot. 

1. Download the bot from here.
2. Go on [https://discord.com/developers/applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and setup your bot there. 
3. Then edit the .env file with all the keys and id's required. 
4. Edit the config.json file. 
!! DO NOT COPY PASTE THIS BELOW. JUST EDIT THE FILE ITSELF !!
   `{
    "appID": "",   --This is from the discord developer page
    "clientId": "",  --This is from the discord developer page
    "channelGreet": "",                                       
    "colorEmbed": "#228B22",                                             
    "citoyen": "",   --This is the whitelist role id when they pass.
    "immigrant": "", --This is the default role that users receive when they join your guild

}`

5. open `/Events/interactions/interactionCreate.js` and Edit everything you want.
6. Then, open every file, from top to bottom and adjust this the way you want. Everything is there and commented. There is a few lines where you need to put roles and channels id.

I am working on a new version of this bot to make it less personal. I never planned to share that bot with anyone, this is why a lot of the files need editing. The next version will have everything needed in the config file.
