# Whitelister
Discord.js 14 bot made to handle whitelisting to a server with a form.

I was using a website like Gather.sh to handle whitelisting of players on my discord server. It was really useful, because we are a strict roleplay server on Fivem and we like to validate players coming in the community with a small resumÃ© of their experience on other servers. Then Gather.sh stopped being supported, was getting ultra laggy and sometimes just broken.. I figured that using a website, for something that could be done directly in discord would be so much better and would reduce the usage of 3rd party software that is often not free. 

This bot, can be started from your own pc, or from a windows/linux VPS or Dedi. (Usually people with FiveM servers will have a server hosted somewhere, i suggest a OVH Game-1 or 2 Dedi as it comes with a Mitigation that is pretty amazing (anti-ddos))

Here is a guide to install this bot. 

Make sure you have this installed on your pc or server first. 

## Prerequisites

1. **Node.js** installed (v18+ recommended): [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)
2. **Git** (optional if cloning from GitHub): [https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/)
3. **VSCode** (to edit and run the bot): [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
4. A Discord account with admin access to your server.
5. If i may suggest, setup a second windows account and run your bot there. This way your VSCode will not become annoying to use. 
> This will make it that you need to start your bot everytime the windows instance reboots.
